# Falling-Blocks-Game
A simple SFML game where you need to dodge falling blocks.

## About
This was created to to help me learn how to use SFML in C#. This is my first completed game that I have created that isn't just a console app and includes graphics.

## Features
- Player movement
- Falling blocks to dodge
- Blocks speed up as game progresses, making it harder
- Score counter

## Art/graphics
This wasn't really made to look nice, so all of the assets were just drawn on paint. The falling obstacles have three different sprites, allowing for some fancy variation to make the game feel a little nicer. I'm most likely not going to go back and add art. I stole the font from somewhere also.

## Screenshots
This is what it looks like for if you don't want to download it.
