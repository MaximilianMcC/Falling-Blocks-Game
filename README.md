# Falling-Blocks-Game
A simple SFML game where you need to dodge falling blocks.

# About
## Why I made it
This was created to to help me learn how to use SFML in C#. This is my first completed game that I have created that isn't just a console app and includes graphics.

## Features
- Player movement
- Falling blocks to dodge
- Blocks speed up as game progresses, making it harder
- Score counter

## Art/graphics
This wasn't really made to look nice, so all of the assets were just drawn on paint. The falling obstacles have three different sprites, allowing for some fancy variation to make the game feel a little nicer. I'm most likely not going to go back and add art. I stole the font from somewhere also.

## Controls
| Thing      | Control         |
|------------|-----------------|
| Move left  | Left Arrow Key  |
| Move right | Right Arrow Key |
| New Game   | Space Bar       |

# Downloading
If you'd like to download the game then download and extract the .zip file. Make sure that you have the `assets` folder in the same folder where the `.exe` is located. Without an assets folder, the game won't work. I'm currently not sure how to include the assets into a single exe file.
